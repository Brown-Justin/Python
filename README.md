# Python
Collection of Python Projects

Hey! 

Welcome to my python3 project page. 

Currently have 3 projects
The combat game is a very simple test, to demonstrate a knowledge of version control via git
The Golf Game is a demonstration of understanding key fundementals of python3. 
Sentiment Analysis is a private project I made. This script will document the sentiment based on the top 10 articles on google. The keyword is inputed by the user. 

I hope you enjoy, and I will have the golf game available via jupiter notebook soon.
